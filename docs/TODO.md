# TODO
- `@Contained` annotation for node inputs
- Better null value handling
- Immutable graph restrictions for more efficient algorithms
- Path Graph (which just has a start and end)
- Custom Exception for Restrictions
- Fix the tests 
- Equals and Hashcode as interface methods?
- Stream functions for edges and nodes
- Graph merging
- less reliance on pairs
- Custom classes for graph algorithms
